## Introduction

A Home Assistant custom component which communicates with FoxESS H-series inverters and derivatives without using FoxESS's cloud.

This means that you're not reliant on FoxESS's cloud infrastructure, so HA keeps working when the cloud goes down.
You can also read solar production etc in real-time, rather than once every 5 minutes.

Depending on your inverter model, you can also set charge periods, work mode, min/max SoC.
See [Supported Features](https://github.com/nathanmarlor/foxess_modbus/wiki/Supported-Features).

Supported models:

- FoxESS H1 (including AC1, AIO-H1 and G2)
- FoxESS H3 (including AC3 and AOI-H3)
- FoxESS H3 PRO
- FoxESS KH
- Kuara H3
- Sonnenkraft SK-HWR
- STAR
- Solavita SP
- a-TroniX AX
- Enpal
- 1KOMMA5°

You will need a direct connection to your inverter.
In most cases, this means buying a modbus to ethernet/USB adapter and wiring this to a port on your inverter.
See the documentation for details.

Recommended installation is through [HACS][hacs]:

1. Either [use this link][my-hacs], or navigate to HACS integration and:
   - 'Explore & Download Repositories'
   - Search for 'FoxESS - Modbus'
   - Download
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Go to Settings > Devices and Services > Add Integration
4. Search for and select 'FoxESS - Modbus' (If the integration is not found, empty your browser cache and reload the page)

## Charge Periods

If your inverter supports setting charge periods, you can use install the [Charge Periods lovelace card](https://github.com/nathanmarlor/foxess_modbus_charge_period_card):

## Services

### Write Service

A service to write any modbus address is available, similar to the native Home Assistant service. To use a service, navigate to Developer Tools -> Services and select it from the drop-down.

### Update Charge Periods

Updates one of the two charge periods (if supported by your inverter).
